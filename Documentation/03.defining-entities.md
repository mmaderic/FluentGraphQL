### Entities
In order to use query builder features, it is required to have database schema entities defined as C# class objects.
All entities should derive from ```IGraphQLEntity``` interface.
```
public class Book : IGraphQLEntity
{
	public Guid Id { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public Guid AuthorId { get; set; }
	
	public Author Author { get; set; }
}
```

Above code snippet shows how to define entity with related nested object. In order to use nested objects it is required to have them named by relationship name defined at the GraphQL engine side. 

Array relationships follow the same rules:
```
public class Book : IGraphQLEntity
{
	public Guid Id { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public Guid AuthorId { get; set; }
	
	public Author Author { get; set; }
	public ICollection<Tag> Tags { get; set; }
}
```
Defined entites when executed will return all defined properties from the database.

*For array relationships it is required to use any of the IEnumerable interface implementing types.*

<br />

### Fragments
In order to have strongly typed fragmented results, class should be derived from ```IGraphQLFragment<TEntity>``` interface.

```
public class AuthorNameAndEmail : IGraphQLFragment<Author>
{
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public string Email { get; set; }
}
```

Same rules are applied for nested fragmented objects:

```
public class AuthorNameAndEmail : IGraphQLFragment<Author>
{
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public string Email { get; set; }
	
	public AddressStreet Address { get; set; }
	public ICollection<BookName> Books { get; set; }
}
```

<br />

### Aggregate containers
In order to use aggregated results, entities should have ```IGraphQLContainerNode``` property defined:
```
public class Author : IGraphQLEntity
{
	public Guid Id { get; set; }
	public string Name { get; set; }
	public string Email { get; set; }

	public Address Address { get; set; }
	public ICollection<Book> Books { get; set; }

	public IGraphQLAggregateContainerNode<Book> BookAggregate { get; set; }
}
```
*Naming convention for aggregate container properties is {EntityName}Aggregate* \
Aggregate nodes are not included by default while generating queries.

<br />

### Actions
Define actions by implementing ```IGraphQLAction<TResponse>``` interface:
```
public class SendEmailRequest : IGraphQLAction<bool>
{	
	public string Email { get; set; }
	public string Subject { get; set; }
	public string Body { get; set; }
}
```
```
public class GetPaymentMethodsRequest : IGraphQLAction<ICollection<PaymentMethod>>
{	
	public string CustomerId { get; set; }
}
```

<br />

### Functions
Currently only functions returning existing database entities are supported. \
Define function class by implementing ```IGraphQLFunction<TEntity>``` interface.
```
public class SearchBooks : IGraphQLFunction<Book>
{
    public string Keyword { get; set; }
}
```
