### Query list of objects
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Build();
var books = await client.ExecuteAsync(query);
```
Executed query will result as ```List<Book>``` object, returning all books from the database.

<br />

### Query an object using its primary key
There are three available methods which can be used:

```
var queryA = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().ById(Guid.NewGuid()).Build();
var queryB = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().ByPrimaryKey("primary key name", "some value").Build();
var queryC = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().ByPrimaryKey(x => x.Id, Guid.NewGuid()).Build();
```

<br />

### Filtering queries using where statement
Filtering queries is done using linq conditional expressions. \
Supported comparison operators are:

	==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Supported method calls are: 

	Any, Equals, GreatherThan, LessThan, In, NotIn, Like, NotLike, LikeInsensitive, NotLikeInsensitive, Similar, NotSimilar

*GreatherThan and LessThan methods are used to compare strings.*

<br />

Simple expression:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.Title == "Some book title" && x.NumberOfPages >= 250).Build();
```
<br />

Filtering by nested entities:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.Author.Name == "Someone").Build();
```
<br />

Filtering by array relationship:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.Tags.Any()).Build();
```
*Above query will return all books which have atleast one tag.*

<br />

```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.Tags.Any(y => y.Name == "my tag name")).Build();
```

<br />

Negate expression using negation operator:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => !x.Tags.Any()).Build();
```

<br />

*More complex filters can be created by combining all of the above functions with multiple &&, || conditional operators.*

<br />

### Sorting query results
Available order by methods:

	OrderBy, OrderByDescending, OrderByNullsFirst, ThenByDescendingNullsLast

Order by multiple fields by chaining some of these method calls:

	ThenBy, ThenByDescending, ThenByNullsFirst, ThenByDescendingNullsLast

Example:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>()
	.Where(x => x.NumberOfPages > 250)
	.OrderBy(x => x.ReleaseDate)
	.ThenByDescending(x => x.Author.Name)
	.Build();
```
Nested objects fields can also be used to sort the results. Only columns from object relationships and aggregates from array relationships can be used for sorting.

<br />

Order by aggregate results:
```
var queryA = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().OrderBy(x => x.TagsAggregate.Count()).Build();
var queryB = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().OrderBy(x => x.TagsAggregate.Max(y => y.CommentsNumber)).Build();
```

<br />

### Distinct query results
After having sorted results using some of the sorting methods, chain builder with DistinctOn() method call. \
For example, fetch the employee with the highest salary from each department:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Employee>().OrderBy(x => x.Department).ThenByDescending(x => x.Salary).DistinctOn(x => x.Department).Build();
```

<br />

### Paginate query results
The operators limit and offset are used for pagination.
Limit specifies the number of rows to retain from the result set and offset determines which slice to retain from the results.
Both values are passed as integer arguments to Limit() method.
```
var queryA = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().OrderByDescending(x => x.ReleaseDate).Limit(5).Build();
var queryB = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().OrderByDescending(x => x.ReleaseDate).Limit(5, 3).Build();
```
