### Query list of objects
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Build();
var books = await client.ExecuteAsync(query);
```
Executed query will result as ```List<Book>``` object, returning all books from the database. \
Queries executed with ```Build()``` do not return nested object entities. 

<br />

### Query an object using its primary key
There are three available methods which can be used:

```
var queryA = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().ById(Guid.NewGuid()).Build();
var queryB = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().ByPrimaryKey("primary key name", "some value").Build();
var queryC = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().ByPrimaryKey(x => x.Id, Guid.NewGuid()).Build();
```
By primary key queries can be [Selected](#Selecting-query-results) or [Aggregated](#Aggregation-queries)

<br />

### Query nested entities
Query builder doesn't include nested entities by default because it might generate circular queries with unexcepted database heavy queries. \
Include nested entities or collections using ```Include()``` method call.
When using ```Select()``` method instead of ```Build()```, Include call isn't necessary as Select will include selected nested entities.

```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().ById(Guid.NewGuid())
	.Include(x => x.Author)
	.Include(x => x.Sales)
	.Build();
```

#### Include recursive nested entities
```
var queryC = _graphQLClient.QueryBuilder<Brand>()
    .Single(x => x.Id == Context.Brands.Cube.Id)
    .Include(x => x.Products.Include(y => y.Category))
    .Build();
```
```
var queryD = _graphQLClient.QueryBuilder<Staff>()
    .Single(x => x.Id == Context.Employees.Lucija.Id)
    .Include(x => x.Manager!.Store)
    .Include(x => x.Manager!.Subordinates)
    .Build();
```
```
var queryE = _graphQLClient.QueryBuilder<Store>()
	.Single(x => x.Id == Context.Stores.Zadar.Id)
	.Include(x => x.Orders.Include(y => new object[] {
		y.OrderStatus,
		y.Staff.Manager!,
		y.OrderItems.Include(z => z.Product)
	})).Build();
```

<br />

### Filtering queries
Filtering queries is done using linq conditional expressions. \
Supported comparison operators are:

	==, !=, >, <, >=, <=

Supported method calls are: 

	Any, Equals, GreatherThan, LessThan, In, NotIn, Like, NotLike, LikeInsensitive, NotLikeInsensitive, Similar, NotSimilar

<br />

Simple where expression:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.Title == "Some book title" && x.NumberOfPages >= 250).Build();
```
<br />

Simple single expression:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Single(x => x.Title == "Exactly this book").Build();
```
Using Where statement returns collection of items while single only one object. \
If there are more result found while using single, exception will be thrown. \
```Single()``` can be used without arguments if there is exactly one record of the selected entity in the database.

<br />

Filtering by nested entities:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.Author.Name == "Someone").Build();
```
<br />

Filtering by array relationship:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.Tags.Any()).Build();
```
Above query returns all books which have atleast one tag.

```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.Tags.Any(y => y.Name == "my tag name")).Build();
```
<br />

Negate expression using negation operator:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => !x.Tags.Any()).Build();
```
<br />

There is no difference between using ```Equals``` and ```==``` operator.
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.Title.Equals("Title") || x.Title == "Title").Build();
```

Use ```GreatherThan``` and ```LessThan``` to compare strings:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.Title.GreatherThan("T")).Build();
```
Above query returns all books which have its title starting with letter after 'T'.
<br />

Other search or pattern matching extension methods are:

	Like, NotLike, LikeInsensitive, NotLikeInsensitive, Similar, NotSimilar 

<br />

Using ```In``` and ```NotIn``` methods:
```
var myIds = new []{ "id1", "id2" };

var queryA = client.QueryBuilder<Status>().Where(x => x.Id.In(myIds)).Build();
var queryB = client.QueryBuilder<Book>.Where(x => x.Title.NotIn(new []{ "Some title", "Exclude me" })).Build();
```

<br />

Compare values with null using either one of these combinations as ```is``` operator is't supported by expression trees:
	
	Property.Equals(null) || !Property.Equals(null) || Property == null || Property != null

<br />

### Filtering nested objects
The where argument can be used in array relationships as well to filter the nested objects. \
Object relationships have only one nested object and hence they do not expose the where argument.

Filter nested collection results by using builder ```Node<TEntity>()``` method call.
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Node<Tag>().Where(x => x.Name.Equals("my tag name")).Build();
```
```Node<TEntity>()``` method recursively finds and selects specified entity. 
In case there are more relations with the same entity type, chain ```Node<TSource>().Node<TDestination>``` to explicitly define which node should have the filter applied to.

<br />

### Sorting query results
Available order by methods:

	OrderBy, OrderByDescending, OrderByNullsFirst, ThenByDescendingNullsLast

Order by multiple fields by chaining some of these method calls:

	ThenBy, ThenByDescending, ThenByNullsFirst, ThenByDescendingNullsLast

Example:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>()
	.Where(x => x.NumberOfPages > 250)
	.OrderBy(x => x.ReleaseDate)
	.ThenByDescending(x => x.Author.Name)
	.Build();
```
Nested objects fields can also be used to sort the results. Only columns from object relationships and aggregates from array relationships can be used for sorting.

<br />

Order by aggregate results:
```
var queryA = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().OrderBy(x => x.TagsAggregate.Count()).Build();
var queryB = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().OrderBy(x => x.TagsAggregate.Max(y => y.CommentsNumber)).Build();
```

<br />

### Distinct query results
After having sorted results using some of the sorting methods, chain builder with DistinctOn() method call. \
For example, fetch the employee with the highest salary from each department:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Employee>().OrderBy(x => x.Department).ThenByDescending(x => x.Salary).DistinctOn(x => x.Department).Build();
```

<br />

### Paginate query results
The operators limit and offset are used for pagination.
Limit specifies the number of rows to retain from the result set and offset determines which slice to retain from the results.
Both values are passed as integer arguments to Limit() method.
```
var queryA = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().OrderByDescending(x => x.ReleaseDate).Limit(5).Build();
var queryB = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().OrderByDescending(x => x.ReleaseDate).Limit(5, 3).Build();
```

<br />

### Aggregation queries
Aggregations on columns can be fetched along with entity values using an aggregation query. \
Currently supported aggregation functions are:
	
	Count, Sum, Avg, Max, Min

To enable aggregated results, entity must have ```IGraphQLAggregateContainerNode<TEntity>``` property defined. \
See [Defining entities](https://github.com/mmaderic/FluentGraphQL/blob/master/Documentation/02.defining-entities.md) for more information.

Generate aggregated query by chaining ```Aggregate()``` or ```Aggregate<TNode>()``` method calls:
```
var queryA = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Aggregate().Count().Build();
var queryB = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Aggregate<Tag>().Count().Build();
var queryC = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Aggregate<Tag>().Max(x => x.CreatedAt).Build();
```
queryA returns aggregate container having count of books while queryB returns list of books with aggregate container having count of Tags for each book.

Aggregate functions can be chainged:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Aggregate<Tag>()
    .Max<int?>(x => new[] { x.Test1, x.Test2 })
    .Min(x => x.Test1)
	.Build();
```
If multiple fields need to be aggregated using the same function, array argument should be used while defining property type.

To aggregate fields of different types using the same aggregate function, specify ```object``` as generic argument and create explicitly new object array:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Aggregate()
	.Max<object>(x => new object[]{ x.Test1, x.Test2 })
	.Build();
```

Returning aggregate container with node data by chaining ```Nodes()``` method call:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Aggregate()
	.Count()
	.Nodes()
	.Build();
```
Above query will return aggregate container having count of books along with all book properties and nested entities.

#### Nested aggregate queries
Aggregate nodes can also be aggregated, meaning you it is possible to have nested aggregate results. Currently only 1 nested level is supported.
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Aggregate<Tag>()
    .Count()
    .Nodes()
    .Aggregate<Link>()
        .Count()
        .End()
    .Build();
```
Currently ```Nodes()``` need to be included for nested aggregate results. \
Building nested aggregate is concluded with the ```End()``` statement.

<br />

### Selecting query results
Queries can be fragmented either by using strongly typed fragment class objects or by selecting specified properties using linq expression.
For more details about fragment objects please see [Defining entities](https://github.com/mmaderic/FluentGraphQL/blob/master/Documentation/02.defining-entities.md).

Select expression can either return single property or new anonymous object contained of multiple properties.
It is not required to call ```Build()``` when using select expression.
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Select(x => x.Id);
```
Above query results in list of book Ids.

```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Select(x => new 
{
	x.Id,
	x.Name
});
```
Only Id and Name properties will be returned by the query as List of anonymous objects.

When using new anonymous object expression, it is possible to change result property names or do expression calculations:
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Author>()
    .ByPrimaryKey(x => x.Id, "b327b30013e94a5f")
    .Select(x => new
    {
        FullName = x.FirstName + " " + x.LastName
    });
```

As anonymous objects sometimes cannot be accepted as result because for example handlers require strongly typed response, it is possible to use ```Cast()``` invoke.
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Select(x => new 
{
	x.Id,
	x.Name
}).Cast();
```
This returns selected properties as part of Book object, while having unselected properties as default values. \
Please note that property names cannot be changed when using ```Cast()```.

#### Selecting nested objects
Nested objects and collections can be selected as well.
```
var query = client.QueryBuilder<Book>().Where(x => x.NumberOfPages > 100)
.OrderByDescending(x => x.ReleaseDate)
.Limit(5)
.Select(x => new
{
    x.Id,
    x.Price,
    x.ReleaseDate,    
	Author = new 
	{
		x.Author.Name
	},
    Tags = x.Tags.Select(x => new
    {
		x.Color,
        x.Link.Name
    })
}).Cast();      
```

#### Including recursive nested entities using Select
Nested object and array relationships can be included using Select method call.
```
var queryB = _graphQLClient.QueryBuilder<Category>()
    .Single(x => x.Id == Context.Categories.RacingBike.Id)
    .Select(x => new
    {
        x.Name,
        Products = x.Products.Include(y => y.Brand)
    });
```
```
var queryC = _graphQLClient.QueryBuilder<Staff>()
    .Single(x => x.Id == Context.Employees.Stipe.Id)
    .Select(x => new
    {
        x.Email,
        Manager = x.Manager.Include(y => y!.Store),
        Orders = x.Orders.Include(y => new
        {
            y.OrderStatus,
            OrderItems = y.OrderItems.Include(z => z.Product)
        })
    });
```
