### Insert mutation
Mutation builder ```Insert()``` method overload is used to either insert single or multiple objects. \
If GraphQL server doesn't have support for single object insert statement, overload for multiple inserts should be used instead.
```
var mutationA = client.MutationBuilder<BookStatus>().Insert(new BookStatus
{	
	Name = "New"
}).Build();

var mutationB = client.MutationBuilder<BookStatus>().Insert(new []
{
	new BookStatus 
	{
		Name = "First"
	},
	new BookStatus
	{
		Name = "Second"
	}
}).Build();
```

Both mutations will return newly inserted objects containing all properties. \
In order to select or return only specific properties, use ```Return()``` method.

First query returns single BookStatus instance, while the second one wraps response into ```IGraphQLMutationReturningResponse<BookStatus>``` object.
Wrapped response contains number of affected rows and a List of inserted entities.

Return only newly inserted item id:
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<ApplicationInstanceStatus>().Insert(new ApplicationInstanceStatus
{
    Status = "New status"
}).Return(x => x.Id);
```

When using ```Return()``` method, same rules are applied as using ```Select()``` when generating queries. For multiple properties selection, create new annonymous object.
Annonymous objects can be casted to strongly typed objects using ```Cast()``` method. 

#### Insert an object along with its related objects through relationships
One-to-one / One-to-many relationships \
Let’s say an author has an object relationship called address to the addresses table and an array relationship called books to the books table.

Example: Insert an author along with their address and a few books.
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<Author>().Insert(new Author
{
    FirstName = "Name",
    LastName =  "Surname",
    Address = new Address
    {
        Street = "new street"
        ZipCode = "10000"
    },
    Books = new[]
    {
        new Book
        {            
            Title = "First book"
        },
        new Book
        {
            Title = "Second book"
        }
    }
}).Build();
```

### Update mutation
Update single object in a table using the primary key. The output type is the nullable table object. \
The mutation returns the updated row object or null if the row does not exist.
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<Book>().UpdateByPrimaryKey(x => x.Id, Guid.NewGuid())
    .Set(x => x.Title, "Updated title")
    .Set(x => x.ReleaseDate, DateTime.Now)
    .Build()
```

Update objects based on their fields using ```UpdateWhere()```:
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<Book>().UpdateWhere(x => x.Title == "Some title")
    .Set(x => x.Title, "new title")
    .Build();
```

Update objects based on nested objects’ fields:
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<Book>().UpdateWhere(x => x.Author.FirstName == author name")
    .Set(x => x.Title, "new title")
    .Build();
```

Update all objects:
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<Book>().UpdateAll()
    .Set(x => x.StatusId, "new status id")
    .Build();
```

Increment int columns:
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<Book>().UpdateByPrimaryKey(x => x.Id, Guid.NewGuid())
    .Increment(x => x.SoldCount)
    .Build();
```

As with insert mutations, update mutations can have selected return properties, while affecting multiple rows, response is beeing wrapped into  ```IGraphQLMutationReturningResponse<TEntity>``` response object.

<br />

### Delete mutation
Delete a single object in a table using the primary key. The output type is the nullable table object. \
The mutation returns the deleted row object or null if the row does not exist.
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<Book>().DeleteByPrimaryKey(x => x.Id, Guid.NewGuid())
    .Build()
```

Delete objects based on their fields using ```DeleteWhere()```:
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<Book>().DeleteWhere(x => x.Title == "Some title")
    .Build();
```

Delete objects based on nested objects’ fields:
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<Book>().DeleteWhere(x => x.Author.FirstName == author name")
    .Build();
```

Delete all objects:
```
var mutation = client.MutationBuilder<Book>().DeleteAll()
    .Build();
```

As with insert or update mutations, delete mutations can have selected return properties, while affecting multiple rows, response is beeing wrapped into  ```IGraphQLMutationReturningResponse<TEntity>``` response object.
